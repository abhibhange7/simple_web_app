 Project Name: Simple frontend and backend app with deployment
**Overview
This project consists of a Frontend (hosted on Firebase) and a Backend (hosted on AWS EC2). The frontend makes requests to the backend API hosted on EC2, and the backend provides responses with JSON data.

Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js (for backend)
npm (for managing dependencies)
Firebase CLI (for deploying frontend to Firebase)
AWS EC2 (for hosting the backend)
Local Setup
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
cd your-repository
2. Set Up Backend (Node.js)
Install dependencies: Navigate to the backend directory and install required dependencies.

bash
Copy code
cd backend
npm install
Run the backend locally: Make sure the backend is set to listen on port 80 (or a custom port) and start the server.

bash
Copy code
node app.js
Test locally: Open a browser or terminal and test the backend endpoint:

bash
Copy code
curl http://localhost:80/api/endpoint
You should receive a response like:

json
Copy code
{
    "message": "Hello from the backend!",
    "timestamp": "2025-01-11T12:00:00.000Z"
}
3. Set Up Frontend (Firebase)
Install Firebase CLI: If you havenâ€™t installed the Firebase CLI, run:

bash
Copy code
npm install -g firebase-tools
Log in to Firebase:

bash
Copy code
firebase login
Navigate to the frontend directory:

bash
Copy code
cd frontend
Install frontend dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Run the frontend locally:

bash
Copy code
firebase serve
Test the frontend: Open the browser and go to http://localhost:5000/. When you click the "Fetch Data" button, you should see the response from the backend.

Deployment
Deploy Backend on AWS EC2
Launch an EC2 instance:

Choose an appropriate EC2 instance type (e.g., t2.micro).
Set up security groups to allow HTTP (80) or HTTPS (443) traffic.
SSH into your EC2 instance:

bash
Copy code
ssh -i your-key.pem ec2-user@<EC2-PUBLIC-IP>
Install Node.js (if not installed):

bash
Copy code
sudo apt install -y nodejs
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
cd your-repository/backend
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Start the backend:

bash
Copy code
node app.js
Verify the backend is running: Test it by accessing the backend through your EC2 instance's public IP:

bash
Copy code
curl http://<EC2-PUBLIC-IP>:80/api/endpoint


Deploy Frontend on Firebase
Initialize Firebase in the frontend project:

bash
Copy code
firebase init
Select the following options:

Choose Hosting for Firebase Hosting.
Select the project you've created on Firebase.
Build the frontend: If using a build system (like webpack or create-react-app), make sure to build the frontend first:

bash
Copy code
npm run build
Deploy the frontend to Firebase: Once the build is complete, deploy your frontend:

bash
Copy code
firebase deploy
Access the deployed frontend: After deployment, Firebase will provide a URL where the frontend is accessible.

Troubleshooting
Backend Issues
Port already in use: If the backend fails to start because the port is already in use, check for running services using ss or netstat and stop them.
Backend not accessible externally: Ensure that the EC2 security group is configured to allow inbound traffic on port 80 (or 443 for HTTPS).
